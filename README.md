This repository is a guide to the implementation of the BallMapper function using the BallMapper package in R (Dlotko, 2019) and the implementation in Python (Gunari et al., 2021)

The guide to R is available through the following Arxiv link: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.14081

The guide to Python is available through Arxiv: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.03022

There are two .ipynb files to recreate the guides. TDABMR.ipynb provides the R code, bmg001.ipynb contains the Python code. Both .ipynb files have commentary to guide the user through the implementation of TDABM. The code in these notebooks is designed to help the reader apply TDABM to their own data.
