There are two .ipynb files to recreate the guides. TDABMR.ipynb provides the R code, bmg001.ipynb contains the Python code. Both .ipynb files have commentary to guide the user through the implementation of TDABM. The code in these notebooks is designed to help the reader apply TDABM to their own data.
